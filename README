Task 1:
  Finish installed the meddle, haven't figure out how to use scripts to answer the following question:
  How many sites are contacted by each app that you use? Does that traffic seem legitimate? Is there anything surprising in your data?

  But I have use the meddle graph web page to find the answer. There is six app captured by the meddle:
    *default*:              11 websites
    NPR:                    2 websites
    MicroMessenger:         6 websites
    GoogleAdsense:          5 websites
    *[fbiab*:               25 websites
    *v1andsqi50100yybdqq*:  15 websites
    The traffic seems legitimate for me.

Task 2£»
	The original script can only process one tcp dump file, and the phone specific part in that script need to be completed.
	I have modified the script to solved the problem I mentioned. I add a script grepForStuffAllFile.sh, this script will go through
    all the files in the specified directory and call the original script on each file. For the phone specific part search, I have modified
	the original grepForStuff.sh file, when your call the grepForStuffAllFile.sh, you can specified the specific strings you want to search, the 
	grepForStuff.sh will grep on all the strings you specified. For example, if you want to search password "123456" and account "loginname" on
	all the tcp dumpfile in directory "tcpdump", you can run the following command:
	./grepForStuffAllFile.sh tcpdump 123456 loginname
	The number of the phone specific strings can be any number till the bash limit.
	
	Unfortunately, I haven't found any leak information except my QQ login number, which has already captured by the meddle. 


Task 3:
